7. Which one of the following most accurately restates the main point of the passage?

A INCORRECT
The assassination did not cause the war, since the assassination was only the last in a chain of events leading up to the war, each of which had equal claim to being called its "cause."

B INCORRECT
The war was destined to happen, since the course of history up to that point could not have been altered.

C CORRECT
Though the statement that the assassination caused the war is true, the term "cause" more fundamentally applies to the conditions that made it possible for that event to start the war.
