Some plants have extremely sensitive biological thermometers. For example, the leaves of rhododendrons curl when the temperature of the air around them is below 0(C (Celsius). Similarly, mature crocus blossoms open in temperatures above 2(C. So someone who simultaneously observed rhododendrons with uncurled leaves, crocuses with mature but unopened blossoms, and a thermometer showing 1(C could determine that the thermometer's reading was accurate to within plus or minus 1(C.

15. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning above?

A INCORRECT
Neither rhododendrons nor crocuses bloom for more than a few weeks each year, and the blossoms of rhododendrons growing in any area do not appear until at least several weeks after crocuses growing in that area have ceased to bloom.

B INCORRECT
Many people find it unpleasant to be outdoors for long periods when the temperature is at or about 1(C.

C INCORRECT
The climate and soil conditions that favor the growth of rhododendrons are also favorable to the growth of crocuses.

D  CORRECT
Air temperature surrounding rhododendrons, which can grow 12 feet tall, is likely to differ from air temperature surrounding crocuses, which are normally only a few inches high, by more than 2(C, even if the two plants are growing side by side.

E  INCORRECT
Certain types of thermometers that are commonly used to measure outdoor temperatures can be extremely accurate in moderate temperature ranges but much less accurate in warmer or colder temperature ranges.
