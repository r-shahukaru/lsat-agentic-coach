Some plants have extremely sensitive biological thermometers. For example, the leaves of rhododendrons curl when the temperature of the air around them is below 0(C (Celsius). Similarly, mature crocus blossoms open in temperatures above 2(C. So someone who simultaneously observed rhododendrons with uncurled leaves, crocuses with mature but unopened blossoms, and a thermometer showing 1(C could determine that the thermometer's reading was accurate to within plus or minus 1(C.
