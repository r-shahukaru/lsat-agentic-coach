14. As a preliminary to negotiating prices, merchants selling goods often specified that payment should be in the coins minted from Senegalese gold. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain this preference?

A  CORRECT
Because refined gold varied considerably in purity, specifying a price as a number of refined-gold coins did not fix the quantity of gold received in payment.

B  INCORRECT
During this period most day-to-day trading was conducted using silver coins, though gold coins were used for costly transactions and long-distance commerce.

C  INCORRECT
The mints were able to determine the purity, and hence the value, of gold coins by measuring their density.
