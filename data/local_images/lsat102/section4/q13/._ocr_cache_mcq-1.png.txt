13. Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above?

A INCORRECT
Insects that collect pollen from primroses do not discriminate between self-pollinating primroses and non-self-pollinating primroses.

B CORRECT
When insect pollinators are scarce, non-self-pollinating primroses produce larger seeds that are more likely to germinate than are seeds from self-pollinating primroses.

C INCORRECT
Self-pollinating primroses that are located in areas with few insects produce no fewer seeds than do self-pollinating primroses that are located in areas with many insects.

D INCORRECT
Many primroses are located in areas in which the soil conditions that are optimal for seed germination are not present.
