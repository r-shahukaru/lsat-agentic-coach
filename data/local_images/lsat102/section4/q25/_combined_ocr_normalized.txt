The dwarf masked owl, a rare migratory bird of prey, normally makes its winter home on the Baja peninsula, where it nests in the spiny cactus. In fact, there are no other suitable nesting sites for the dwarf masked owl on the Baja peninsula. But a blight last spring destroyed all of the spiny cacti on the Baja peninsula. So unless steps are taken to reestablish the spiny cactus population, the dwarf masked owl will not make its home on the Baja peninsula this winter.

D) The dwarf masked owl will not make its winter home on the Baja peninsula only if that region contains no spiny cacti.
E) Suitable nesting sites must be present where the dwarf masked owl makes its winter home.
