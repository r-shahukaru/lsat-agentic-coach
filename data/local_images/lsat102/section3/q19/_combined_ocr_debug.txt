When an ordinary piece of steel is put under pressure, the steel compresses; that is, its volume slightly decreases. Glass, however, is a fluid, so rather than compressing, it flows when put under pressure; its volume remains unchanged. Any portion of a sheet of glass that is under sustained pressure will very slowly flow to areas under less pressure. Therefore, if a single, extremely heavy object is placed in the middle of a horizontal sheet of glass of uniform thickness and if the glass is able to support the weight without cracking, then the sheet of glass will eventually _______.

19. Which one of the following most logically completes the argument?

A INCORRECT
become larger in size yet still be of uniform thickness

B INCORRECT
flow toward the point at which the pressure of the object is greatest

C INCORRECT
compress, although not as much as a piece of steel would

D INCORRECT
divide into exactly two pieces that are equal in neither size nor shape to the original piece of glass

E CORRECT
be thinner in the portion of the glass that is under the pressure of the object than in those portions of the glass that are not under that pressure
