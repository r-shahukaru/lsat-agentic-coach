A commonly accepted myth is that left-handed people are more prone to cause accidents than are right-handed people. But this is, in fact, just a myth, as is indicated by the fact that more household accidents are caused by right-handed people than are caused by left-handed people.

7. The reasoning is flawed because the argument

A INCORRECT
makes a distinction where there is no real difference between the things distinguished

B CORRECT
takes no account of the relative frequency of left-handed people in the population as a whole

C INCORRECT
uses the word "accidents" in two different senses

D INCORRECT
ignores the possibility that some household accidents are caused by more than one person

E INCORRECT
gives wholly irrelevant evidence and simply disparages an opposing position by calling it a "myth"
