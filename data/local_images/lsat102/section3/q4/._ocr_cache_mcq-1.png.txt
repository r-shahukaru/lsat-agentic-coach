4. Which one of the following, if true, would most seriously undermine the scientist's hypothesis?

A INCORRECT  
Diatoms are a microscopic form of algae that has remained largely unchanged since the last ice age.

B INCORRECT  
Computer models suggest that a large increase in ferrous material today could greatly promote the growth of oceanic algae.

C INCORRECT  
The dust found in the air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice contained other minerals in addition to the ferrous material.

D CORRECT  
Sediment from the ocean floor near Antarctica reflects no increase, during the last ice age, in the rate at which the shells that diatoms leave when they die accumulated.
