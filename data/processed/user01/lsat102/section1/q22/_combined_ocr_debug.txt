22. Which one of the following most completely and accurately
summarizes the argument of the passage?
A) By calling into question the possibility that complex
systems can be studied in their entirety, organicists
offered an alternative to the analytic method favored by
nineteenth-century scientists.
B
Organicists did not offer a useful method of studying
complex systems because they did not acknowledge
that there are relationships into which an entity may
enter that do not alter the entity's identity.
Organicism is flawed because it relies on a theory that
both ignores the fact that not all characteristics of
entities are defining and ultimately makes the
acquisition of knowledge impossible.
D
Organicism does not offer a valid challenge to the
analytic method both because it relies on faulty theory
and because it is based on a misrepresentation of the
analytic method.

E)
In criticizing the analytic method, organicists neglected
to disprove that scientists who employ the method are
able to discover the laws and initial conditions of the
systems they study.
