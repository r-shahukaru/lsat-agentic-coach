16. The author of the passage would most likely agree with which
one of the following assertions?
A
Though some believe the current form of the powwow
signals the decline of tribal culture, the powwow contains
elements that indicate the continuing strength of
tribalism.
B
The logical outcome of the recent increase in intertribal
activity is the eventual disappearance of tribal culture.
C
Native Americans who participate in both tribal and
intertribal activities usually base their identities on
intertribal rather than tribal affiliations.
D
The conclusions of some sociologists about the health of
native American cultures show that these sociologists are
in fact biased against such cultures.
E
Until it is balanced by revitalization of tribal customs,
intertribalism will continue to weaken the native American
sense of identity.
