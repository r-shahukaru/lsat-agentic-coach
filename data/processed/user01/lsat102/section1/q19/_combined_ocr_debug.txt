19. With which one of the following statements would the author
of the passage be most likely to agree?
A
The resurgence of the powwow is a sign that native
American customs are beginning to have an important
influence on Euroamerican society.
B
Although native Americans draw conscious distinctions
between tribal and intertribal activities, there is no
difference in how the two types of activity actually
function within the context of native American society.
C
Without intertribal activities, it would be more difficult for
native Americans to maintain the cultural differences
between native American and Euroamerican society.
D
The powwow was recently revived, after an extended
hiatus, in order to strengthen native Americans' sense of
ethnic identity.
E
The degree of urbanization, intertribal communication,
and politicization among native Americans has been
exaggerated by proponents of the theory of Pan-
Indianism.
