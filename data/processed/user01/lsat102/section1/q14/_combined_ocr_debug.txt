14. Which one of the following best summarizes the main idea of
the passage?
A
Despite the fact that sociologists have only recently
begun to understand its importance, intertribalism has

B
Native Americans are currently struggling with an
identity crisis caused primarily by the two competing
forces of tribalism and intertribalism.
C
The recent growth of intertribalism is unlikely to
eliminate tribalism because the two forces do not
oppose one another but instead reinforce distinct
elements of native American identity.
D
The tendency toward intertribalism, although prevalent
within native American culture, has had a minimal effect
on the way native Americans interact with the broader
community around them.

E) Despite the recent revival of many native American tribal
traditions, the recent trend toward intertribalism is likely
